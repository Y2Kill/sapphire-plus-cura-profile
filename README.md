# sapphire-plus-cura-profile
 Cura slicer profile for Sapphire Plus 3D printer from TwoTrees

How to install.
1. Copy the contents of the "profile" folder (folders "definitions", "extruders", "meshes") to your Cura settings folder (e.g. C:\Users\@___YOUR USERNAME___@\Application Data\cura\4.8). Or directly to the programm folder (e.g. c:\Program Files\Ultimaker Cura 4.8.0\resources\ require administrative access).
2. Run Cura slicer. Sapphire Plus printer should appear in "add printer" menu - add it.
3. Enjoy :).

By default "sapphire_plus_platform.stl" will be used as printer paltform model. You van find preview in the "pics" folder. There is also "sapphire_plus_platform.3mf" but you have to align it correctly if you want to use it.

Sections "Start G-code" and "End G-code" were taken from Sapphire Pro printer.
